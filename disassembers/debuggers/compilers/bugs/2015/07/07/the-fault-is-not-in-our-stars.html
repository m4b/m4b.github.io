<p><img src="/images/phosphorus-jutrzenka.jpg" alt="Jutrzenka&#39;s morning and evening stars"></p>

<p>It was all David&#39;s fault that I was still up at 1 in the morning, bleary eyed, tired, and starting to get suspicious of mathematics -- and that there was definitely a &#39;bug&#39; in <code>je_malloc</code> and the compiler that generated <code>je_malloc</code> and in LLVM&#39;s disassembler, maybe in <code>gdb</code>, and definitely in Intel&#39;s documentation, and probably in pretty much everything.</p>

<p>But let me start from the beginning.</p>

<h1 id="a-tale-of-two-disassemblers">A Tale of Two Disassemblers</h1>

<p><img src="/images/such_hacks.png" alt="OCaml david code"></p>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night - I was demoing <a href="http://github.com/m4b/rdr">some software</a> to my friend, the eponymous David from the above, at a coffee shop, in May around noon, when this whole mess started.  I was showing him this particular feature which allowed me to disassemble an arbitrary symbol name from the command line, and in my hubris, I foolishly showed him the <code>malloc</code> disassemblies.</p>

<p>Now, there are several <code>malloc</code> providers on linux.  One of these is the fateful <code>libjemalloc.so.1</code>, whose <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc">git repo is here</a>, and with whom our story starts.  However, this story doesn&#39;t so much involve them as it does their <em>compiled</em> code (not on the dev branch, but the master, at least at the time of this writing), and so we should absolve them of any wrong doing in these matters.</p>

<p>In any event, I had noticed before that my program was piping out errors for <code>libjemalloc.so.1</code>&#39;s <code>malloc</code> implementation, but since this was a fly by night operation intended to wow David, I hadn&#39;t checked into it yet.</p>

<p>But David, being the good, curious human that he is, asked about the errors when he saw them.  And that&#39;s when it all began -- a nightmarish journey into the seedy underbelly of linux dynamic libraries, broken disassemblers, pernicious debuggers, treacherous compilers and suspicious documentation.</p>

<p>Come join me in my fun-time adventures!</p>

<h3 id="0x66-0x66-0x48-0xe8-0x59-0xcf-0xff-0xff">0x66 0x66 0x48 0xe8 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff</h3>

<p>I&#39;m running Arch Linux, and when I run <code>lldb /usr/lib/libjemalloc.so.1 -o &quot;disass -b -n malloc&quot;</code>, the last line it disassembles is a <code>call</code> instruction:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"> &lt;malloc+1151&gt;66 66 48 e8 59 cf         callw  0xcf59
</code></pre></div>
<p>It is exactly here, 1157 bytes in, that <code>lldb</code> (based on LLVM v3.6) gives up and will disassemble no more.  This is unusual, because if you inspect the <code>_DYNAMIC</code> array, <code>libjemalloc.so.1</code> reports that its export, <code>malloc</code>, begins at <code>0x5f90</code>, and is exactly 1543 bytes in size (your implementation will vary; in fact, compiling <code>libjemalloc</code>&#39;s master git branch yields a larger <code>malloc</code> and various examples like this much earlier on in the procedure - but again, this may vary with compiler flags, compilers, distros, and toaster models).</p>

<p>Yet <code>lldb</code> tells us that the function is 1157 bytes long (because that&#39;s where it stops).  So where did 386 bytes go? (there&#39;s probably an off by one error here, don&#39;t judge me)</p>

<p>To fully understand this situtation, we&#39;ll need to understand Intel legacy prefix codes, REX prefixes, opcode tables, crazy Intel instruction documentation syntax, signed integers, <code>gdb</code>, x86-64 mode, and other sordid low-level details.</p>

<h3 id="prefixes">Prefixes</h3>

<p>I haven&#39;t finished reading the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.pdf">Intel manual</a> yet (so I&#39;m not an expert), probably be done in a few days, but basically there are 4 groups of legacy prefixes, with <code>0x66</code> indicating the so-called &quot;operand-size override prefix&quot;.  According to their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operand-size override prefix allows a program to switch between
16- and 32-bit operand sizes.  Either size can be the default;
use of the prefix selects the non-default size.
2-2 Vol. 2A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me just say here, because I really can&#39;t resist, and hopefully maybe there&#39;s a good reason for this behavior (but probably not, just the onus of historical cruft), but you know the instruction set is insane when &quot;either size can be the default&quot; and the operand-size override prefix switches to the other.  Like, just choose one... and make that the default?</p>

<p>Anyway, 64-bit x86 processors (the only processor kind you should care about anymore) added REX prefixes, which do lots of things in 64-bit mode, but for our purposes, we&#39;ll only consider the <code>0x48</code> byte, which says &quot;My operand is 64-bits wide&quot;.  The accompanying documentation says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not all instructions require a REX prefix in 64-bit mode.
A prefix is necessary only if an instruction references one
of the extended registers or uses a 64-bit operand.
If a REX prefix is used when it has no meaning, it is ignored.
2-8 Vol. 2A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Importantly, &quot;Only one REX prefix is allowed per instruction.&quot;</p>

<p>Confusingly however, when it comes to the legacy prefixes, we&#39;re told:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For each instruction, it is only useful to include up to
one prefix code from each of the four groups (Groups 1, 2, 3, 4).
Groups 1 through 4 may be placed in any order relative to each other.
2-1 Vol. 2A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... &quot;it is <strong>only</strong> <em>useful</em> to include <em><em>up to one</em></em>&quot;. We&#39;ll interpret this unambiguous piece of writing to mean we can have as many prefixes as we want.</p>

<p>However, directly above this on the same page, in the instruction diagram, in the prefix section, we&#39;re told &quot;Up to four prefixes of 1 byte each&quot;, which seems to indicate we can have a max of four prefixes.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, I&#39;ve experimented with instruction sequences with multiple prefixes, multiple REXs, etc., but they seem to be ignored.  So we&#39;ll go with the former interpretation, that we can include as many as we want.</p>

<h3 id="intel-arcana">Intel Arcana</h3>

<p>With such information firmly in hand, we can now understand <code>0x66 0x66 0x48 0xe8 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff</code>... or can we?  First off, why are there two <code>0x66</code> bytes?  I have no idea.  Secondly, why are they followed by an <code>0x48</code>? It seems to say... use a 16-bit width, and then use a 64-bit width, but if we actually look up the instruction (<code>0xe8</code>) in Intel&#39;s one-byte opcode table, it tells us that <code>0xe8</code> is a &quot;near CALL^f64&quot; with a <code>Jz</code> operand, where ^ means superscript.</p>

<p>First we need to look up what an <code>f64</code> superscript means, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operand size is forced to a 64-bit operand size when in 64-bit
mode (prefixes that change operand size are ignored for this
instruction in 64-bit mode)
A-6 Vol. 2C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the operand size must be 64-bits, or 8 bytes.  Our example instruction only has a 4 byte operand/immediate though; but if we consult the instruction&#39;s entry in the 64-ia we see that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 64-bit mode the relative offset is always a 32-bit immediate
value which is sign extended to 64-bits before it is
added to the value in the RIP register for the target calculation.
Vol. 2A 3-99</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Importantly, the documentation <em>does</em> definitely state that prefixes that change operand size are ignored in 64-bit mode for instructions marked with the <code>f64</code> superscript, of which <code>call</code> is one.</p>

<p>The only other component is the <code>Jz</code> operand encoding, which is two parts, the first part, &quot;J&quot;, meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The instruction contains a relative offset to be added
to the instruction pointer register
A-2 Vol. 2C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the &quot;z&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Word for 16-bit operand-size or doubleword for 32 or 64-bit operand-size
A-3 Vol. 2C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the operand is a <em><strong>signed</strong></em> operand, with either a 16-bit or 64-bit size, depending on whether the operand-size prefix is set?</p>

<p>So what we know seems to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operand-size prefix is ignored</li>
<li>Operand-size prefix is not ignored? (&quot;Word for 16-bit operand-size&quot;)</li>
<li>Operand is signed</li>
<li>Up to 4 legacy prefixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re confused and unsure what is correct; everyone seems to be.  At the time of this initial writing (about a month ago), <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18386">neither</a> <code>gdb</code> <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20150504/274835.html">nor</a> <code>lldb</code> correctly disassembled <code>0x66 0xe8 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff</code>, so we&#39;re in good company.  <strong>Update</strong>: both of these bugs have been corrected, thanks to open source process goodness, and the internet.</p>

<h3 id="llvm">LLVM</h3>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s run <code>llvm-mc --disassemble</code> on the instruction starting 1151 bytes in at <code>libjemalloc</code>&#39;s <code>malloc</code> to test what we know:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0x66 0x66 0x48 0xe8 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> llvm-mc --disassemble
    .text
    callw   53081
&lt;stdin&gt;:1:31: warning: invalid instruction encoding
0x66 0x66 0x48 0xe8 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff
                              ^
</code></pre></div>
<p>That didn&#39;t seem to work (this was the original error that set all this off).</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all those stupid <code>0x66</code> that <code>gcc</code> inserted (also, again, why)?  Let&#39;s test if multiple <code>0x66</code> cause a problem for LLVM&#39;s disassembler:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0x66 0x66 0xe8 0x59 0xcf&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> llvm-mc --disassemble
    .text
    callw   53081
</code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>llvm-mc</code> seems ok with a couple <code>0x66</code>&#39;s.  What about 5 of them?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0x66 0x66 0x66 0x66 0x66 0xe8 0x59 0xcf&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> llvm-mc --disassemble
    .text
    callw   53081
</code></pre></div>
<p>The spec was vague on redundant prefixes, so we&#39;ll let this slide (if you actually test multiple <code>0x66</code>&#39;s against an x86-64 cpu in 64-bit mode it seems to allow it - which just means the silicon that I tested it on allowed it).</p>

<p>But there is something else really wrong here, it looks like <code>llvm-mc</code> is incorrectly disassembling <code>callw</code>&#39;s immediate.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some C code to illustrate the matter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">//i_saw_the_sign.c</span>

<span class="cp">#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="cm">  */</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, let&#39;s be absolutely clear: <code>0xcf59</code> interpreted as a signed short (i.e., only 2 bytes in size) is equivalent to <code>0xffffcf59</code> interpreted as a signed int (4 bytes in size), which we write in decimal notation as <code>-12455</code>.</p>

<p>As such, if <code>0x66 0xe8 0x59 0xcf</code> is disassembled to <code>callw 53081</code> then the 16-bit operand <code>0xcf49</code> must have been interpreted as an unsigned short or a non-sign extended 4-byte int, i.e., <code>0x0000cf49</code> (or similarly, as an 8-byte int), and not the correct signed short or sign-extended 4-byte int, which we write in decimal as <code>-12455</code>.</p>

<p>So <code>llvm-mc</code> incorrectly disassembles short immediates in call.  As it turns out, it was just a <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20150504/274835.html">missing case in a switch statement</a> (I love not having pattern matching on closed algebraic data types, because otherwise these kinds of trivial errors are avoided and I can&#39;t have fun).  It did, however, require <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-commits/Week-of-Mon-20150504/275326.html">a further fix</a> if <code>0x66</code> prefixed a call instruction in a 64-bit binary.</p>

<p>But, <em>at least</em> we solved the mystery of <code>libjemalloc.so.1</code>&#39;s <code>malloc</code>&#39;s missing bytes - a bad disassembler.  But what does a <em>good</em> disassembler have to say?  And what even is a good disassembler?  And why on earth was that instruction sequence generated in the first place?  Who has the answers to these burning questions?</p>

<h1 id="gcc">GCC</h1>

<p>Of course we can only bash on LLVM so much, since it&#39;s written in C++, so it&#39;s not their fault.  But at some point we have to ask, why is there an instruction sequence like <code>0x66 0x66 0x48 0x59 0xcf 0xff 0xff</code> in the compiled binary in the first place?  And is this an invalid instruction, or not?</p>

<p>If we invoke the tried and true <code>gdb</code> on <code>libjemalloc.so.1</code> with <code>disas /r malloc</code> we&#39;ll eventually find the following at 1151 bytes in (and gdb doesn&#39;t stop until, you guessed it, the <em>correct</em> 1543 bytes later):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">   0x00007ffff7bad40f &lt;+1151&gt;:  66 66 48 e8 59 cf ff ff data16 data16 callq 0x7ffff7baa370 &lt;__tls_get_addr@plt&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>gdb</code> seems to think the instruction is <code>data16 data16 callq 0x7ffff7baa370</code> (I&#39;m going to turn a blind eye to those double <code>data16</code>&#39;s).</p>

<p>Importantly, I want us to subtract <code>0x7ffff7baa370</code> from <code>0x00007ffff7bad417</code> (<strong>NOTE</strong>: the call/jmp offset is always relative to the next instruction, which is 8 bytes later, so <code>0x00007ffff7bad40f + 0x8</code>).</p>

<p>The result should be 12455 (in decimal).  In other words, the import symbol stub for <code>__tls_get_addr</code> is 12455 bytes away, in the negative direction, from the <code>callq</code> instruction.  Thus we need to add a relative offset of <code>0xffffcf59</code> (-12455) to the instruction pointer to call the imported procedure <code>__tls_get_addr</code> (if you&#39;re curious, it&#39;s imported from <code>/usr/lib/ld-2.21.so</code> at offset <code>0x124a0</code> (all offsets my own).  I simply did <code>rdr -m -f __tls_get_addr</code> to get that magical number).</p>

<p>This seems right; <code>gdb</code> correctly ignores the <code>0x66</code> prefix.  If however, we were to take <code>lldb</code>&#39;s word for it, we&#39;d be looking for/calling a function 53081 bytes away from <code>0x00007ffff7bad417</code>, which puts us at <code>0x7ffff7bba370</code>, somewhere inside some random procedure.</p>

<p>So it seems like at this point we can sit back and declare <code>gdb</code> a &quot;good&quot; disassembler and <code>lldb</code> a &quot;bad&quot; disassembler, at least in this case --- but in doing so, we&#39;d be wrong.</p>

<p>The bad news is that if you remove the REX prefix, <code>0x48</code>, then <code>gdb</code> will also incorrectly disassemble the <code>call</code> when a <code>0x66</code> is present in 64-bit mode.</p>

<p>If we compile a simple C program like as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// callw.c</span>
<span class="c1">//compile with -Wall -Werror -o callw callw.c</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then use that binary to do some hex editing.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care about the program crashing, then just insert the instruction sequence  <code>66 e8 01 00 00 00</code> somewhere after where main begins, using your favorite hex editor.  Or you can do it carefully so the program doesn&#39;t crash; I&#39;ll leave that as an exercise.  Or just download this <a href="/files/callw">binary</a> and scope it out for yourself.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re finished, run <code>gdb callw</code> and break on main; run, and then disassemble using the /r option.  You should see something like as follows (I call <code>0x06</code> bytes forward, because I don&#39;t want the program to crash):</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice <code>gdb</code> thinks the callw has a 16-bit immediate, and so starts disassembling the extra 2 bytes as a separate instruction (<code>add    %al,(%rax)</code> to be precise).</p>

<p>But if you step through the program, the cpu (I presume, unless there is some black magic going on when trapping with a debugger, which is why I rewrite the binary to not crash) actually jumps a 32-bit value (well technically calls, but you know what I mean), hence demonstrating x86-64 cpus (at least this one, and the others I&#39;ve tested on) ignore the <code>0x66</code> prefix in 64-bit mode, which matches the spec.</p>

<p>We can actually prove whether 0x66 is ignored or not using a special program; <a href="#appendix">see the appendix</a>.</p>

<p>Also, it will also mess up your <code>%rip</code> qua <code>gdb</code> if the call lands you in the middle of an instruction.</p>

<p>So... <code>gdb</code> incorrectly disassembles this kind of corner case too though.  I submitted a <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18386">bug there as well</a>.</p>

<h1 id="coda">Coda</h1>

<p>In the end, while the particular details here will soon be untrue, because open source software as high-profile as gdb or llvm gets fixed, what remains interesting to me are two salient, and what I think are lasting object lessons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Redundant Independent Verification Is Scientific Verification</li>
<li>Something Darker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="redundant-independent-verification-is-scientific-verification">Redundant Independent Verification Is Scientific Verification</h2>

<p>There is no such thing as a canonical disassembler, because all disassemblers come from man, and to err is human.  As such, the more <em>independent</em> disassemblers we have (independent in the sense of using disjoint codebases for disassembly logic), the closer we are to approaching what the the &quot;ideal disassembler&quot; <em>should</em> produce (for a given architecture).</p>

<p><code>lldb</code> and <code>gdb</code> failed at disassembling real corner cases, and in different ways (and then they got fixed, and this is good).  However, had there been a third (or fourth), reliable and independent disassembler, I would argue the likelihood that it too would have failed on the same input is unlikely --- which then gives the researcher better data to act on what the programs are telling them, instead of untangling a mess of reduplicated error.  As a result, I would argue that <em>redundant independent verification</em> <strong>triangulates</strong> the semantics of an instruction set --- and the more we have, the more accurate our analyses will be, and the more confident we can be that disassembly is working correctly.</p>

<p>This is one of the primary reasons I still actively use both <code>gdb</code> and <code>lldb</code>: they give me different perspectives on the same objects.  Unfortunately, in the x86-64 bit world, they&#39;re really the only disjoint disassemblers that are available.  <code>disnasm</code> is broken, and only works with 32 bit modes; similarly <code>objdump</code> doesn&#39;t seem to work, and I believe it&#39;s using <code>bdf</code> anyway, which violates the disjoint codebase requirement.</p>

<h2 id="something-darker">Something Darker</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable that in the four most recent editions of the
UNIX system programmer’s manual the Bourne shell grammar described
in the manual page does not admit the command <code>who|wc</code>.
This is surely an oversight, but it suggests something darker:
nobody really knows what the Bourne shell’s grammar is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that something darker is going on: maybe no one really knows how x86 &quot;works&quot; anymore.</p>

<p>The compiler writers, bless them, read the same spec I read (and am still reading); and it seems ambiguous in some places in ways that it shouldn&#39;t be ambiguous. To harp on examples from this post, once again, we are told:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only one REX prefix is allowed per instruction.
-- 2-8 Vol. 2A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what does this mean?  It doesn&#39;t #UD if there are two REX prefixes; similarly for legacy prefixes.  So what in particular &quot;isn&#39;t allowed&quot;?  I can do it; I&#39;m not arrested, and neither is my machine, so what purpose does this sentence serve in a &quot;formal&quot; specification of an instruction set?</p>

<p>This may seem pedantic, or alarmist, but what sincerely worries me is that <em>at best</em> this is ambiguous, and at worst it is symptomatic of a substantially less palatable conclusion.  I&#39;m not sure which disjunct it is, but neither really make me very happy when contemplating their possibility.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we <em>can</em> take comfort that all of these problems are our own devising; the fault isn&#39;t in some magic dropped from the sky, but lies solely on ourselves, and as such, <em><em>we</em></em> can solve them (because we created them), and make them better, either through venerable open source processes, or formal methods, or solutions yet undreamed of.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s my happy note. Now it&#39;s time for me to get back to computering.</p>

<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>

<h2 id="clever-program">Clever Program</h2>

<p>We can use a sequence like <code>0x66 0xe8 0xff 0x7f 0xff 0xff</code> inserted say somewhere in the middle of a binary approximately <code>0x10001</code> bytes long, with a sequence of #UD bytes approximately 32767 bytes away, and a graceful exit sequence approximately -32769 bytes away, to test if the <code>0x66</code> prefix was ignored or not.</p>

<p>Why? Because if the immediate is 16 bits, the call will take the 32767 branch and #UD; but if the immediatel is 32 bits, then it is signed, and will take the -32769 branch and gracefully exit.</p>

<p>Clever program is clever.</p>
